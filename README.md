# Summary
Per usual, not sure.  

# Stack
## client - this repo
- React and Vite. Regarding React, at some point the intent is to re-write with different front end and compare. Hopefully we get there.
- [Daisy](https://daisyui.com/)
- [valtio](https://valtio.pmnd.rs/)
## custom server - [elysia](https://elysiajs.com/). 
- Not yet uploaded to github.  
- Currently it is helping with uploads processing, although I'm not even sure if it is necessary in this case, but I learned a few things along the way, so it is already useful
## api - [strapi](https://strapi.io/)  
- Not yet uploaded to github. 
- It is using sqlite3. Depending on the enjoyment, I may switch to something else.
